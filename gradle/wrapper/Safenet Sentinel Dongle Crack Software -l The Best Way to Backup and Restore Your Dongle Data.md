In this article, we will explain what Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software is, how it works, and how you can use it to secure your software products.
  
## What is Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software?
 
Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software is a product of Thales Group, a global leader in data protection and digital security. It consists of two main components: the Sentinel SuperPro software and the Sentinel HL SuperPro hardware key.
 
The Sentinel SuperPro software is a toolkit that allows you to implement various licensing models and features for your software, such as trial periods, expiration dates, feature levels, concurrent users, network licenses, and more. You can also use the software to monitor and manage your licenses remotely through a web-based interface.
 
The Sentinel HL SuperPro hardware key is a USB device that acts as a physical lock for your software. It contains a secure memory chip that stores your license information and a cryptographic processor that performs encryption and decryption operations. When you distribute your software, you also provide your customers with a hardware key that they need to plug into their computer in order to run your software. Without the key, your software will not function properly.

1. You use the Sentinel SuperPro software to create a license file that defines the parameters and restrictions of your software license. You can customize the license file according to your business needs and preferences.
2. You use the Sentinel SuperPro software to program the license file into the Sentinel HL SuperPro hardware key. You can also encrypt your software code using the same software to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
3. You deliver your software and hardware key to your customer. Your customer installs your software on their computer and plugs in the hardware key into a USB port.
4. When your customer runs your software, the software checks for the presence of the hardware key and verifies its validity. If the key is present and valid, the software runs according to the license file stored in the key. If the key is absent or invalid, the software displays an error message or limits its functionality.

By using Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software, you can ensure that only authorized users can access and use your software according to the terms and conditions that you set. You can also prevent piracy, cracking, or reverse engineering of your software by making it dependent on a physical device that cannot be easily duplicated or manipulated.
  
## How to use Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software?
 
If you want to use Safenet Sentinel Dongle Software for your software products, you need to follow these steps:

1. Purchase the Sentinel SuperPro software and the Sentinel HL SuperPro hardware keys from Thales Group. You can choose from different types and sizes of hardware keys depending on your needs and budget.
2. Download and install the SafeNet Client Software on your computer. This is a driver and client software that allows your computer to interface with the hardware keys. You can download it from Thales Group's website or from DigiCert's website.
3. Use the Sentinel SuperPro software to create and program your license files into the hardware keys. You can also use the same software to encrypt your software code if you wish.
4. Distribute your software and hardware keys to your customers. You can also provide them with instructions on how to install and use them.
5. Use the Sentinel SuperPro web interface to monitor and manage your licenses remotely. You can view reports, statistics, alerts, and more.
