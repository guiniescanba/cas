Nutrients are substances that provide energy and materials for growth and repair of body cells. There are six major types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Each nutrient has a specific function and role in the body.

One way to learn more about nutrients and how to identify them in food is to use Gizmo, an online simulation tool that allows you to test different foods for the presence of various nutrients. Gizmo is based on a lab activity called Student Exploration: Identifying Nutrients, which you can find online or download as a PDF file.
 
In this article, we will guide you through the steps of using Gizmo to identify nutrients in food. You will need a computer with internet access and a browser that supports Flash.
 
## Step 1: Access Gizmo
 
To access Gizmo, go to [https://www.explorelearning.com/index.cfm?method=cResource.dspView&ResourceID=115](https://www.explorelearning.com/index.cfm?method=cResource.dspView&ResourceID=115) and click on Launch Gizmo. You will need to create a free account or log in with an existing one.
 
## Step 2: Explore the Gizmo interface
 
Once you launch Gizmo, you will see a screen like this:

The Gizmo interface consists of four main parts:
 
- The Food samples area, where you can select different foods to test for nutrients.
- The Test results area, where you can see the results of your tests for each nutrient.
- The Nutrient information area, where you can read about the functions and sources of each nutrient.
- The Toolbar, where you can access the instructions, vocabulary, questions, and other features of Gizmo.

## Step 3: Test foods for nutrients
 
To test a food for a nutrient, follow these steps:

1. Select a food from the Food samples area by clicking on it. You can choose from 24 different foods, such as apple, cheese, egg, bread, etc.
2. Select a nutrient from the Test results area by clicking on its name. You can test for six nutrients: carbohydrate (starch), carbohydrate (sugar), protein, fat, vitamin C, and iron.
3. Click on Test. A test tube will appear in the Test results area with a color indicator that shows whether the food contains the nutrient or not. The color codes are:
    - Blue: positive result (the food contains the nutrient)
    - Red: negative result (the food does not contain the nutrient)
    - Green: inconclusive result (the test cannot detect the nutrient)
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for different foods and nutrients until you have tested all the combinations you want.

## Step 4: Learn more about nutrients
 
To learn more about each nutrient and its function and sources in the body, click on its name in the Nutrient information area. You will see a pop-up window like this:
 ![Nutrient information window](https://www.explorelearning.com/screenshot/115/IdentifyingNutrients_NutrientInfo.jpg) 
The window contains information such as:

- The chemical structure of the nutrient (if applicable)
- The role of the nutrient in the body (such as providing energy, building muscles, fighting infections, etc.)
- The recommended daily intake of the nutrient (based on age and gender)
- The common food sources of the nutrient (such as fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products, meat, etc.)
- The effects of deficiency or excess of the nutrient (such as anemia, scurvy, obesity, diabetes, etc.)

You can close the window by clicking
