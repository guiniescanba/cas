The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in November 2011. It was later ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and VR devices. The game has received critical acclaim and has sold over 30 million copies worldwide.
 
One of the features of Skyrim is its modding community, which has created thousands of user-generated content for the game, ranging from bug fixes to new quests, weapons, armor, characters, and more. Some of these mods require official updates or patches from Bethesda to work properly.
 
One of these updates is Update 13-RELOADED, which is a torrent file that can be downloaded from The Pirate Bay. This update fixes some issues with the game's performance, stability, and compatibility with mods. It also adds some new features, such as:
 
- A new difficulty mode called Legendary that makes enemies more challenging and removes the level cap.
- A new feature called Legendary Skills that allows players to reset their skill levels to 15 and refund their perk points, effectively making them infinite.
- A new option to change the appearance of the player character at the Ragged Flagon in Riften.
- A new option to toggle combat music on or off.
- A new option to adjust the field of view (FOV) for PC users.
- A new option to enable or disable Kinect voice commands for Xbox 360 users.

The torrent file is about 260 MB in size and requires a previous installation of Skyrim version 1.8 or higher. It also requires a crack file to bypass the game's DRM protection. The torrent file has a high number of seeders and leechers, indicating its popularity and availability.
